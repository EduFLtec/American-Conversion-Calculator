# American-Conversion-Calculator

This is a continuing work in progress. I recently moved back to America from Japan. 
Itâ€™s a practical project I wanted to make to help my wife understand the wild west of US measurements. 
While metric to US measurements can be found from a quick search, I wanted to create a web app that held them all on the same page. 
Hopefully it can be useful to other foreigners living here or US expats abroad.
